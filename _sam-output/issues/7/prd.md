## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Summary
Update the Chess Academy website's color scheme from the current black/white/gold palette to a warm wooden chess theme, replacing the existing CSS variables with colors that evoke classic wooden chessboards (light and dark wood tones).

### Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Define Wooden Chess Color Palette**
  - Research/select appropriate wooden chess colors:
    - Dark wood (for dark squares): Rich walnut/mahogany tones (e.g., `#5D4037`, `#4E342E`)
    - Light wood (for light squares): Maple/birch tones (e.g., `#D7B899`, `#E8D4B8`)
    - Accent color: Warm amber/honey wood highlight (e.g., `#B8860B`, `#CD853F`)
  - Document the final color choices with hex values
  - Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA standard)
  - Acceptance: Color palette documented with 8 colors matching current variable structure

- [ ] **Task 2: Update CSS Root Variables**
  - Open `/tmp/sam-repos/sam-ai-bot/test2/css/styles.css`
  - Modify the `:root` selector (lines 4-18) with new wooden theme colors:
    - `--color-black` → Dark wood primary
    - `--color-dark` → Secondary dark wood
    - `--color-white` → Light wood/cream
    - `--color-off-white` → Very light wood for backgrounds
    - `--color-accent` → Wood grain accent/highlight
    - `--color-accent-dark` → Darker accent for hover states
    - `--color-gray` → Muted wood tone for secondary text
    - `--color-light-gray` → Light wood tone for borders
  - Update the CSS comment from "Chess Theme" to "Wooden Chess Theme"
  - Acceptance: All 8 color variables updated in `:root` selector

- [ ] **Task 3: Adjust Shadow Variables for Wooden Theme**
  - Review shadow variables (`--shadow-light`, `--shadow-medium`, `--shadow-heavy`)
  - Consider adjusting shadow colors to have a warm undertone (brown-tinted shadows)
  - Example: Change `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)` to `rgba(62, 39, 35, 0.15)` for warmer shadows
  - Acceptance: Shadow variables harmonize with wooden color palette

- [ ] **Task 4: Visual Testing and Refinement**
  - Open `index.html` in a browser
  - Review all sections for proper color application:
    - Header/navigation visibility
    - Hero section gradient appearance
    - Button contrast and hover states
    - About section readability
    - Course cards styling
    - Contact section appearance
    - Footer legibility
  - Test on both light and dark sections of the page
  - Acceptance: All sections render correctly with wooden theme, no visual artifacts

- [ ] **Task 5: Responsive Design Verification**
  - Test the color scheme at all breakpoints:
    - Desktop (>1024px)
    - Tablet (768px-1024px)
    - Mobile (<768px)
    - Small mobile (<480px)
  - Verify mobile menu colors work with wooden theme
  - Check hamburger icon visibility against new background
  - Acceptance: Color scheme looks correct at all viewport sizes

- [ ] **Task 6: Accessibility Validation**
  - Verify text contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
  - Check button text is readable against wooden button backgrounds
  - Ensure links are distinguishable
  - Test focus states are visible
  - Acceptance: All text/background combinations pass contrast checks

### Technical Considerations
- All color changes are isolated to the `:root` CSS variables in `css/styles.css` (lines 4-18)
- No changes required to HTML or JavaScript files
- CSS variables cascade automatically, so updating `:root` values propagates everywhere
- Shadow colors may need warm undertones to match the wooden aesthetic
- Consider whether gradient backgrounds need adjustment for smooth wood-tone transitions

### Dependencies
- No external dependencies
- No build process required
- Changes can be tested immediately by opening `index.html` in a browser

### Estimated Complexity
**Simple** - This is a straightforward CSS variable update. The codebase is well-structured with all colors centralized in CSS variables, requiring changes to only 8-11 values in a single file. The main effort is selecting an aesthetically pleasing wooden color palette with proper accessibility.
